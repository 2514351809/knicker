Knicker is a Java interface to the Wordnik API.

You can use Knicker to add dictionary lookup capabilities to your own Java
programs. Knicker has been designed to be simple and straightforward to use. It
does not require any third party libraries, just Java 1.6 or higher.

To use Knicker, you need a Wordnik API key. You can get one here:
http://www.wordnik.com/developers

Knicker looks for the system property WORDNIK_API_KEY, so you need to set it
before you try to use Knicker:
System.setProperty("WORDNIK_API_KEY", <your API key>);

Then just call the API methods using the Knicker class:

Knicker.lookup("zebra");

There are methods in Knicker for each of the Wordnik methods.
